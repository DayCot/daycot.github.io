            <p>
              Each day, we provide you with a quick coding challenge to keep your programming skills sharp. 
              These bite-sized challenges are perfect for solving during your commute or as a quick brain exercise before bed. 
              Solutions are available in multiple programming languages for your convenience.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="What programming languages are supported?">
            <p>
              We currently support multiple popular programming languages including C#, Dart, Java, Javascript, Kotlin, Python, Sql, and Swift. 
              Each challenge can be solved in any of these languages, allowing you to practice in your preferred language 
              or learn a new one. We're constantly working to add support for more languages based on user demand.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="How does the streak system work?">
            <p>
              The streak system tracks your daily coding practice. Each day you complete a challenge, your streak increases. 
              The longer your streak, the more achievements you unlock. We also send daily reminders to help you maintain 
              your streak and build a consistent coding habit.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="Can I customize my notification preferences?">
            <p>
              Yes! You can customize when and how you receive notifications. Choose your preferred time for daily reminders, 
              and select whether you want to receive notifications for new challenges, streak milestones, or motivational quotes.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="Is there a community or way to discuss solutions?">
            <p>
              Not yet, but we are planning our next step so you can connect with other users, so you can share problems and feedbacks.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="What if I miss a day?">
            <p>
              Don't worry! While maintaining a streak is motivating, missing a day won't affect your progress. 
              You can always catch up on missed challenges, and your streak will continue from your last completed challenge. 
              The focus is on consistent learning rather than perfect attendance.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="Are the challenges suitable for beginners?">
            <p>
              Absolutely! Our challenges are just simple enough to keep up your interest. 
              I'd suggest leetcode or hackerrank for more advanced challenges.
